# CartGoals - Shopify Cart Gamification App

CartGoals is a Shopify app that increases average order value by turning shopping carts into gamified quests with multi-goal progress tracking. Merchants use it to visualize customer progress toward rewards like free shipping, free gifts, discounts, and gift cards.

## The Problem CartGoals Solves

Single-goal cart progress bars stop working once customers hit free shipping. A customer adds $50 to reach the threshold, sees "Free shipping unlocked!", and stops adding items. The motivation disappears.

CartGoals creates a journey instead. Free shipping unlocked? Now chase the free gift at $100. Then the 15% discount at $150. Each goal increases cart value.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Goal Progress Tracking**: Stack up to 5 goals (free shipping, gifts, discounts, gift cards, mystery rewards)
- **Auto-Detect Shipping Zones**: Reads your Shopify shipping settings automatically. Zero manual configuration.
- **Celebration Animations**: Sparkle effects and confetti when customers unlock goals
- **Works With All Themes**: Compatible with Dawn, Debut, Brooklyn, Prestige, Impulse, and all Shopify 2.0 themes
- **Mobile Responsive**: Beautiful on desktop, tablet, and phone
- **Lightweight**: Asynchronous script with minimal page speed impact

## How It Works

1. Install CartGoals from Shopify App Store
2. App auto-detects your shipping zones and thresholds
3. Configure up to 5 goals with custom icons and descriptions
4. Progress bar appears on cart page and cart drawer
5. Customers chase rewards, average order value increases

## Common Questions

**Q: Does CartGoals slow down my Shopify store?**
A: No. CartGoals uses a lightweight asynchronous script optimized for performance. It loads after your page content and has minimal impact on page speed metrics.

A: Yes. CartGoals offers 6 color presets, 13 emoji icons, custom goal descriptions, multiple animation styles, and flexible placement options. Match your brand without writing code.
